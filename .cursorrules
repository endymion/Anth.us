This is the Gatsby site project for https://anth.us. The project contains documentation for content creation and management.

Key documentation files:
- docs/content-guide.xml: Comprehensive guide for creating articles, posts, and pages
  This file contains structured documentation using XML with Markdown content inside <content> tags.
  It explains different content types, creation processes, and best practices.

Content structure:
- Blog articles (src/blog/*.mdx): Long-form, comprehensive content with citations and illustrations. These are well-researched pieces that dive deep into topics about AI, technology, and solutions.
- Posts (src/blog/posts/*.mdx): Short, time-sensitive updates similar to social media posts. These are meant for frequent, concise updates that can be shared directly on social platforms.
- Solutions are in src/blog/solutions/*.mdx
- Static pages are in src/pages/*.js
- Images should go in src/blog/images/ or src/images/
- Diagrams are created in src/blog/diagrams/ using PlantUML

When helping create content:
1. Reference docs/content-guide.xml for structure and requirements
2. Follow the appropriate template based on content type:
   - For articles: Include citations, illustrations, and comprehensive coverage
   - For posts: Keep it concise, timely, and social-media friendly
3. Ensure all required frontmatter is included
4. Use Markdown for content formatting
5. Add appropriate tags and metadata
6. Place images and diagrams in their designated directories
