This is the Gatsby site project for https://anth.us. The project contains documentation for content creation and management.

Key documentation files:
- docs/content-guide.xml: Comprehensive guide for creating articles, posts, and pages
  This file contains structured documentation using XML with Markdown content inside <content> tags.
  It explains different content types, creation processes, and best practices.

Content structure:
- Blog articles are in src/blog/*.mdx
- Posts are in src/blog/posts/*.mdx
- Solutions are in src/blog/solutions/*.mdx
- Static pages are in src/pages/*.js
- Images should go in src/blog/images/ or src/images/
- Diagrams are created in src/blog/diagrams/ using PlantUML

When helping create content:
1. Reference docs/content-guide.xml for structure and requirements
2. Follow the appropriate template based on content type
3. Ensure all required frontmatter is included
4. Use Markdown for content formatting
5. Add appropriate tags and metadata
6. Place images and diagrams in their designated directories
