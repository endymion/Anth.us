Sam Altman's new essay "The Intelligence Age" offers a compelling perspective on technological unemployment that aligns with our long-held views. While acknowledging AI's significant impact on labor markets, he maintains an optimistic yet grounded outlook: "most jobs will change more slowly than most people think, and I have no fear that we'll run out of things to do."

His analogy of the lamplighter—a profession made obsolete by technological progress—effectively illustrates how technological advancement creates new forms of valuable work. Today's jobs would seem frivolous to our ancestors, yet they generate unprecedented prosperity and meaning.

This perspective resonates with our approach to AI development: focusing on augmenting human capabilities rather than wholesale replacement. As we've explored in our article on <a href="/blog/paradox-of-automation">the paradox of automation</a>, the key lies in understanding that meaningful work evolves alongside technology, creating new opportunities for human creativity and contribution.

The future of work isn't about displacement—it's about transformation and expansion. As we develop AI solutions, we're consistently finding that the most powerful applications enhance rather than replace human capabilities, opening new avenues for meaningful contribution and value creation.
