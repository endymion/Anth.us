Google has released interactive mode for NotebookLM to all users, and the experience is remarkably natural. After months of listening to the same "Deep Dive" podcast hosts through the AI interface, you can now interrupt and engage with them directly in conversation.

This advancement represents a significant step in making AI interactions feel more human and contextual. The ability to interrupt and redirect conversations, just as you would with a real person, creates an uncannily natural experience.
