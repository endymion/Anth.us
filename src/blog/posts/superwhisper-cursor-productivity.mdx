Pro tip: When working with Cursor's agent mode or other AI coding assistants, you naturally shift from being a hands-on coder to more of a manager role. Instead of typing symbols and syntax, you spend more time expressing ideas and providing high-level instructions and feedback.

While macOS's built-in dictation is capable, [SuperWhisper](https://superwhisper.com/) elevates the experience significantly. It uses an LLM to review and refine transcriptions, making it remarkably accurate for technical discussions. This enhanced accuracy means you can maintain high-velocity development with coding agents even when your hands are occupiedâ€”whether you're cooking breakfast, taking notes during a walk, or doing other tasks.

The workflow becomes beautifully simple:
1. Speak your thoughts and instructions
2. SuperWhisper converts and refines them to text
3. Cursor's AI agents interpret and execute your commands

This combination transforms how we interact with coding agents. It frees you to focus on architectural decisions and creative problem-solving while the agents handle implementation details. The result is a more natural, efficient development process that adapts to your context rather than demanding your full attention at the keyboard.

But this hands-free coding approach is just the beginning. Once you're comfortable directing development through voice, you can scale up: imagine maintaining multiple feature branches simultaneously, each with its own planning documents to maintain context. While your agents work on implementing one feature, you're free to architect the next, keeping multiple development streams flowing in parallel.

After countless hours of pair programming with AI agents, it's refreshing to find tools that make the experience even more natural and friction-free.
